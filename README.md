# DOTA 2 INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENTS ANALYSIS (2019-2022)

I decided to do this project because it combines what I love most, which is analyzing data, with one of my favorite hobbies. I really enjoyed the process Dota 2.

This project uses Python and data analysis techniques to extract, clean and transform data from international Dota 2 tournaments from 2019 to 2022. Afterwards, a dashboard will be created from this prepared data, which will display the most important statistics of the professional competition of Dota 2. This provides an overview of the current landscape of this electronic sport.

The following is an initial view of the dashboard, as well as the key findings described. It should be noted that this analysis is based on the last 3 years, if older data were available, some statistics would possibly change (collected data limitations)

In terms of number of events and annual prizes, international events are clearly decreasing in 2020, in line with COVID-19. Most of the events were cancelled as a precaution. Only 1 event can be seen in the report, which took place in January 2020 (just before the pandemic).

The "TOP 5 TEAMS" graph shows the number tournaments and prizes won by professional Dota 2 teams. Here you can see that the team that has won the most money for winning tournaments is Team Spirit, followed by OG Sports, both with two tournament wins. However, there is something curious: the top 3 and 4 in this ranking have won 5 tournaments each, which could be interpreted as more money earned, but the amount earned is barely more than half of the first two amounts. Well, this can be explained by the fact that the first two places in this ranking have won at least one TI. This is the most important tournament of the year and has a much larger prize pool.

The "REGIONS" graph shows the number of tournaments and prizes won by each region. To clarify, each professional Dota 2 team is registered within a region, which is why the figures were also analysed on a regional level. Here you can see that the region that has earned the most money for winning tournaments is Western Europe, with 13 tournaments on the podium and a prize pool that is far in excess of its successors, demonstrating the dominance of this region in recent years of this e-sport. Also, there's something funny about this chart: Western Europe and China have almost the same amount of prize money, but China has 7 more podium appearances. This is because Team Spirit (from the Eastern Europe region) has one TI and one other tournament win (first place in both), while no team from China has had a TI win for many years and international participation is on the decline. While South America has historically been considered the region with the lowest level of success, the last two years have seen South American teams take the world by surprise at competitions and it is clear that the region is making great strides in the e-sport.

The "TOP 5 HEROES" graph shows the number of times a hero has been chosen and their win rate. As you can see, Tiny is the most popular hero of the last few years, appearing in a total of 475 games and a win rate of 49%, which is about average compared to the other heroes. In second place is Puck, who has appeared in a total of 331 games and has a win rate of 55% (the highest win rate of this top 5). Note that this top is highly variable year to year, as the preference of the heroes selected is highly dependent on the current patch of the game. If you want more information you can access the board that is attached to this repository.

Last but not least, we have a few important statistics from all the games of the past three years, like the win rate per faction (Radiant or Dire), the max, min and avg duration of the games, and the number of max, min and avg deaths in the games. It is interesting, and also explained by the current Dota 2 patch, how the win percentage varies depending on the side of the match. For instance, in the last patch (end of 2022), the Dire faction had a higher chance of winning because the map layout and access options were more convenient for them, making team fights easier for them.
